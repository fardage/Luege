# Luege — Project Naming Decision

## Name

**Luege** (pronounced LOO-eh-geh)

## Meaning

Swiss German for "to watch" or "to look." A fitting name for a media player focused on discovering and watching video content.

## Rationale

- Distinctive and memorable — rarely used in tech
- Directly relevant to the product's purpose
- Short, easy to say and spell
- Strong availability: GitHub and common domains (.app, .dev, .io) appear unclaimed
- No conflicting software projects using this name

## Note

"Luege" may be confused with the German word "Lüge" (lie) by non-Swiss German speakers, but this is a minor concern given the distinct spelling and context.
